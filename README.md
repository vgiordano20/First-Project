It was an average day in the city of Metropolis.
The superhero Metroboy had successfully kept the city safe for a while.
It had been 37 years since the last major supervillian attack.
But all would change today...
MetroBoy had been dormant since the last major supervillian attack. Nobody has seen him since Megaminds defeat in 1987.
With the city in silence a new villain arose on September 17, 2024, and his name is Spawn.
A villain in hiding, a shadow amongst the dark, began to wreak havoc on the city of Metropolis. And nobody was there to stop him.
A woman by the name of Sara Lee had close relations with MetroBoy, and she had an idea of where our Metropolis heroes has gone.
